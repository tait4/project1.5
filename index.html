           <h2>History </h2>
           <p>The Milwaukee Bucks team was an expansion team founded in 1968, along with the Phoenix suns that same year. The Milwaukee Bucks had a disappointing first year. They finished with a record of 27-55, placing 7th in the Eastern Conference, and failed to make the playoffs. The next year, they picked Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the first overall pick. He greatly influenced the team's direction and improved their winning record for the next two years. In 1971, Kareem led the Buck to an NBA championships for the first time in their team's history. For the next few decades, the Bucks remained semi-competitive but did not make any NBA final appearances. In the year 2013, the Bucks drafted Giannis Antetokounmpo. With  Giannis at the forefront of the team, the bucks continue to improved in the eastern standing nearly each year and won the NBA champion in 2021, fifty years after their first championship. Current day, the team is continuously working to enhance their roster and stay competitive in the ever-changing league. The Bucks recently drafter Damian Lillard (a 7 time all-star) in September, in hopes of making it back to the NBA finals.</p>
